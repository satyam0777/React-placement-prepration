   - Each question includes an explanation and sample code.
   - Practice answering these questions out loud or by writing code in your editor.

3. **Hands-on Practice**
   - For each practice question, write your own solution in a new file or a CodeSandbox/StackBlitz project.
   - Compare your solution with the provided examples.

4. **Revise Before Interviews**
   - Quickly review the **Key Points** and **Example Code** sections for each topic.
   - Focus on the most commonly asked topics (see the summary table in the notes).
