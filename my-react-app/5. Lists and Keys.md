<!-- # 5. Lists and Keys

## Concept

- Rendering lists in React is done using `.map()`.
- Each list item needs a unique `key` prop for efficient updates.

## Why it matters in interviews

- Youâ€™ll often need to render dynamic lists (e.g., todos, users).
- Using keys correctly prevents bugs and improves performance.

## Example

```jsx
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map(fruit => (
        <li key={fruit}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Key Points

- Keys should be unique and stable (avoid using array index if possible).
- Keys help React identify which items changed, added, or removed.

## Practice Question

- Build a component that takes an array of objects (with `id` and `name`) and renders them as a list. -->

## ðŸ“š Core Concept

React efficiently updates and renders UI by maintaining a virtual DOM. When rendering a list of elements, React uses a **`key` prop** to uniquely identify each element and track changes.

> **Rendering lists** = `.map()` + `key` prop  
> **Why key?** â†’ Helps React optimize re-renders (diffing algorithm)

## ðŸ§  Why This Is Important in Interviews

- Lists are used **everywhere**: todos, messages, notifications, users, posts, products.
- Using `key` incorrectly can cause **buggy UIs** or poor performance.
- Interviewers may ask for:
  - Rendering logic using `.map()`
  - Real-world use case (like rendering dynamic search results)
  - Explanation of **why keys are needed**
  - Pros/cons of using index as a key
  - Dynamic list manipulation (add, delete, update)

## ðŸ’» Basic Example

```jsx
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map(fruit => (
        <li key={fruit}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
