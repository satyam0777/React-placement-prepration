# 10. Interview Tips for React

## Concept

- Beyond coding, interviews test your understanding, communication, and problem-solving skills.

## Why it matters in interviews

- Good communication and clear explanations can set you apart, even if you make minor mistakes.

## Example Tips

- **Explain your thought process** as you code.
- **Write clean, readable code** (use meaningful names, keep components small).
- **Use hooks and functional components** (modern React standard).
- **Handle edge cases** (empty lists, loading/error states).
- **Test your code** (try different inputs, check for bugs).
- **Ask clarifying questions** if requirements are unclear.

## Practice Question

- Practice explaining how you would build a todo app, step by step, including state management, adding/removing items, and persisting data.
