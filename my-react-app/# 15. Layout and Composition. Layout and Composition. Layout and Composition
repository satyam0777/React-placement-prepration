# 15. Layout and Composition

## Concept

- **Layout** in React is about arranging components to build complex UIs.
- **Composition** means building components from other components, often using `props.children`.

## Why it matters in interviews

- Shows your ability to structure reusable and maintainable UIs.

## Example

```jsx
function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: "1px solid #ccc", padding: 16, borderRadius: 8 }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Card>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>Description goes here.</p>
</Card>
```

## Key Points

- Use composition to avoid duplication.
- `props.children` lets you pass elements between opening and closing tags.

## Practice Question

- Create a `Layout` component with a header, main, and footer, and use it to wrap a page.
