# 1. JSX and Components

## Concept

- **JSX** is a syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing you to write HTML-like code in React.
- **Components** are reusable, independent pieces of UI. React apps are built by composing components.

## Why it matters in interviews

- Youâ€™ll often be asked to build or explain components.
- Understanding JSX is fundamental for React.

## Example

```jsx
// A simple functional component using JSX
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Welcome name="Satyam" />
```

## Key Points

- JSX must have one parent element.
- Use `{}` to embed JavaScript expressions.
- Components can be functions or classes (functions are preferred).

## Practice Question

- Build a component that takes a `message` prop and displays it inside a `<p>` tag.
