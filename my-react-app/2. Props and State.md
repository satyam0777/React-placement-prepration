# 2. Props and State

## Concept

- **Props**: Data passed from parent to child component. Read-only.
- **State**: Local data managed by the component. Can change over time.


##  Concept Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Props
- **Definition**: Data passed **from parent to child** component.
- **Behavior**: **Immutable** inside child components.
- **Use Case**: Sharing information between components.

### ðŸ”¸ State
- **Definition**: Local data **owned and managed** by the component.
- **Behavior**: **Mutable** via React hooks (e.g., `useState`).
- **Use Case**: Tracking dynamic, interactive behavior (UI updates).

##  Intuition

- **Props** are like ingredients from a supplier â€“ the chef (component) can't change them.
- **State** is the chefâ€™s own spice box â€“ can be changed anytime during cooking.

## Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter({ step }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + step)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Counter step={2} />
```

## Key Points

- Props are immutable in the child.
- State is managed using `useState` in functional components.
- Changing state triggers a re-render.

## Practice Question

- Create a component that accepts a `title` prop and displays it. Add a button to toggle the visibility of the title using state.
