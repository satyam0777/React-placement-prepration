# 2. Props and State

## Concept

- **Props**: Data passed from parent to child component. Read-only.
- **State**: Local data managed by the component. Can change over time.

## Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter({ step }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + step)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Counter step={2} />
```

## Key Points

- Props are immutable in the child.
- State is managed using `useState` in functional components.
- Changing state triggers a re-render.

## Practice Question

- Create a component that accepts a `title` prop and displays it. Add a button to toggle the visibility of the title using state.
