# 8. Controlled Components (Forms)

## Concept

- **Controlled components** are form elements whose values are controlled by React state.
- The inputâ€™s value is set by state, and changes are handled via event handlers.

## Why it matters in interviews

- Handling forms is a common requirement in real-world apps and interviews.

## Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function NameForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted name: ${name}`);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Key Points

- The value of the input is always driven by React state.
- Use `onChange` to update state as the user types.
- Prevent default form submission with `e.preventDefault()`.

## Practice Question

- Create a form with two inputs (name and email) and display the values below the form as the user types.
