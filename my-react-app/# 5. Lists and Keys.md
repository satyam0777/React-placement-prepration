# 5. Lists and Keys

## Concept

- Rendering lists in React is done using `.map()`.
- Each list item needs a unique `key` prop for efficient updates.

## Why it matters in interviews

- Youâ€™ll often need to render dynamic lists (e.g., todos, users).
- Using keys correctly prevents bugs and improves performance.

## Example

```jsx
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map(fruit => (
        <li key={fruit}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Key Points

- Keys should be unique and stable (avoid using array index if possible).
- Keys help React identify which items changed, added, or removed.

## Practice Question

- Build a component that takes an array of objects (with `id` and `name`) and renders them as a list.
